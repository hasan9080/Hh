Enhance Kubernetes API server performance by serving consistent **list** requests
directly from its watch cache, improving scalability and response times.
This feature requires a newer etcd version (v3.4.31+ or v3.5.13+) and ensures
data consistency while reducing the need for resource-intensive quorum reads from etcd.

See the Kubernetes documentation on [Semantics for **get** and **list**](/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#semantics-for-get-and-list) for more details.
