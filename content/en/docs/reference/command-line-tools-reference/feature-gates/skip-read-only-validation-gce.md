Disable validation for Google Cloud Engine (GCE) regarding the 
usage of PersistentDisk volumes. In previous versions, workloads 
(e.g., Deployments, DaemonSets, etc.) using PersistentDisk volumes 
were required to operate in read-only mode. This validation, despite 
incurring relatively high implementation costs, provided limited value. 
Starting from version 1.29, this validation is no longer enforced. If 
you encounter issues with this change in a specific use-case, you can 
set the SkipReadOnlyValidationGCE feature gate to false to re-enable 
the validation. If necessary, please file a Kubernetes bug report with 
details.
